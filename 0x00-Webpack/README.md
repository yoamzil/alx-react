# Webpack Setup

This README provides a concise guide on setting up a basic Webpack project with a specific focus on the initial task (`task_0`). Follow the steps below to establish a minimal project structure:

1. **Folder Structure:**
   - Create a folder named `task_0`.

2. **Dependencies:**
   - Install `webpack` and `webpack-cli` as developer dependencies using npm.
   - Install `jQuery` as a regular dependency.

3. **Source Files:**
   - Create a `src` directory with an `index.js` file.
   - Import `jQuery` in the `index.js` file and manipulate the DOM.

4. **Webpack Configuration:**
   - Ensure that running Webpack generates the JavaScript and HTML files in the `dist` folder.
   - Avoid using a custom webpack config file.
   - Verify that opening the main HTML file does not result in any console errors.
